"a 'Data completeness' estimates the percentage of relevant broadband connections in the constituency that are covered by this data. Data for postcodes with less than 4 connections is not published. So, for example, where 'data completeness' reads as 98%, this means that we estimate that 2% of connections are in postcodes for which data has not been released.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contains information licensed by the Office of Communications. Information about the data is given below:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This data is based on House of Commons Library analysis of Ofcom’s Connected Nations data. Ofcom collected and analysed data from major fixed telecoms operators (BT, Virgin Media, Sky, Talk Talk, Vodafone and KCOM). The availability data also includes coverage information provided by alternative network providers (B4RN, BU-UK, City Fibre, Gigaclear, Hyperoptic, ITS and Relish). Due to variations in broadband performance over time, Ofcom cautions that the data should not be regarded as a definitive and fixed view of the broadband infrastructure but rather a snapshot of current variation in availability and performance across the country. Due to privacy concerns Ofcom did not present the information in postcodes with fewer than four broadband connections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The underlying data was gathered by Ofcom in May 2017. The local picture may have changed since then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ofcom's 'availability' data is given in respect of premises in each postcode. In order to aggregate data these availability percentages are applied to the total number of connections in each postcode. This is a simplifying assumption but is necessary for aggregation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The UK averages shown here are those calculated on the basis of the postcode-level data (for comparability with the constituency/ward averages). They will not precisely match those found in Ofcom's Connected Nations report.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
